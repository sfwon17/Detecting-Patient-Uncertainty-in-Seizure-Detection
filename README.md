# Detecting-Patient-Uncertainty-in-Seizure-Detection

The technique utilised mathematical logic and deep learning for uncertainty detection on patient level. It does not detect uncertainty on a specific segment/event/time.

## Scenario
Given a patient's EEG data containing hours of recordings, the algorithm assesses whether the trained model can confidently classify the entire recording at the patient level. By applying a confidence threshold, the algorithm determines the level of uncertainty in the modelâ€™s predictions on patient-level, ensuring safe and reliable assessment of EEG recordings. 

## Getting Started
Make sure you have your EEG data in numpy format. Run the script in the following orders:
1. samdsd
2. r
