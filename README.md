# Detecting-Patient-Uncertainty-in-Seizure-Detection

The technique utilised mathematical logic and deep learning for uncertainty detection on patient level. It does not detect uncertainty on a specific segment/event/time.

#### Scenario
Given a patient data, containing hours of EEG, user would like to find out whether the trained model is able to confidently classify entire recording correctly, based on confidence threshold.
